      This static filter group is used for all indexers to capture all relevant events.

    description: |
      This group will be automatically populated by the factory-tracker as soon as a new pool is created.
      It is also manually populated from the factories.csv for known factories.
      This group is used to filter-out irrelevant contracts (other Uniswap-like protocols) which also emit the "topics" above but we don't want to process them.
      If you want swap of "all" Uniswap-like protocols, you can remove this filter group and use "topics" filter group everywhere.
